## Overview

**AniPortable** brings core AniList features directly into your browser, allowing seamless interaction with your anime list. Instantly update episode progress, view statistics, and manage your lists without navigating away from your current tab.

---

## Features

- Instantly update episode progress or score using arrow buttons — or click to type an exact number.
- View your completed anime stats in a bar chart, with filters for year and season.
- Separate your Watching list into **Behind** and **Caught Up**, so you know exactly what needs attention.
- Keep anime in Watching even after finishing the last episode — ideal for screenshots or reviews — then move it to Completed with one click.
